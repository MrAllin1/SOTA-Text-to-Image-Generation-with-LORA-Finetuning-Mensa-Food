I kicked off a second fine‐tuning run on the same base model with higher capacity and longer training, using the following settings:

--LoRA configuration: rank 8, alpha 8

--Dataset: 1,667 Mensa meal images, at 512×512 resolution

--Batch size & precision: 1 image per step, mixed‐precision (fp16) via accelerate

--Training steps: 30,000 with AdamW optimizer (learning rate 2 × 10⁻⁴)

--Checkpointing: saved adapter weights every 5,000 steps

--Output: final LoRA weights pushed to username/my-lora-model-second-train on the Hugging Face Hub

I chose to push these settings—and to allow some overfitting—because:

--Mensa menus change infrequently, so memorizing specific dishes can actually boost generation fidelity.

--A higher resolution (512²) and larger LoRA rank (8) capture more fine‐grained plate details.

--Longer training (30k steps) with a slightly higher LR (2e-4) accelerates convergence on this narrow domain.

--Overfitting is less risky here: the domain is small and stable, so the model won’t “hallucinate” wildly novel meals.
